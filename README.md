About
=====

This is a Facter library to use omreport to gather information about a system include hardware, storage controller and front panel options.

Issues / Limitations
--------------------

# There is a lot more this can gather.
# It's very explicitly configured for Puppet Enterprise and the RPM installation of srvadmin.  It has no concept of alternative locations to store cached configuration or access the commandline tools.
